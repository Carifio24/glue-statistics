============

This documentation details the funtionality and methods used to create a generic glue viewer. This documentation is also meant to help new Glue developers become aquainted with creating a new viewer and hope to be a resource for kickstarting their own code. Most of the information on this document can be found on the official Glue documentation page, and additional information may be found there. However, this file will be more streamlined to help developers create viewers compared to the original documentation.
